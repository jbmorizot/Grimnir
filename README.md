Grimnir
=======

Grimnir is a replacement font for Skyrim UI. In order to use it you have to: 

0. Download the Grimnir font. It is encapsuled in a .swf file named *fonts_en_mod.swf*.

1. Copy the *fonts_en_mod.swf* file into the _common/Skyrim/Data/Interface_ folder. DO NOT delete the original *fonts_en.swf* file (or whatever name it could have i.e. *fonts_FR.swf*) for it contains the other fonts needed to display the game properly. 

2. Then you must open the fontconfig.txt file (you may want keep a copy, even if the original file is easily findable on the Internet) and add the line 
    *fontlib "Interface\fonts_en_mod.swf"*

3. Then you must replace every occurence of the name "Futura Condensed" by "Grimnir" And Voil√†.

This font contains only latin glyphs, so Cyrillic and Japanese won't be displayed.
