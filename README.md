Grimnir
=======

Grimnir is a replacement font for Skyrim UI. In order to use it you have to: 

1. Download the Grimnir font. It is encapsuled in a .swf file named *fonts_en_mod.swf*.

2. Copy the *fonts_en_mod.swf* file into the _common/Skyrim/Data/Interface_ folder. DO NOT delete the original *fonts_en.swf* file (or whatever name it could have i.e. *fonts_FR.swf*) for it contains the other fonts needed to display the game properly. 

3. donwload the *fontconfig.txt* file here and replace the original with it it in the Interface folder

OR you can open the *fontconfig.txt* file by yourself (you may want keep a copy, even if the original file is easily findable on the Internet), add the line *fontlib "Interface\fonts_en_mod.swf"*. and replace every occurence of the name "Futura Condensed" by "Grimnir".
