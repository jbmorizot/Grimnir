Grimnir
=======

Grimnir is a replacement font for Skyrim UI. In order to use it you have to 
1.  copy the "fonts_en_mod.swf" file into the data/interface folder. DO NOT delete the original fonts_en.swf file (it contain the other fonts needed to display the game properly). 
2.  Then you must open the fontconfig.txt file and add the command 
    fontlib "Interface\fonts_en_mod.swf"
3.  Then you must replace every occurence of the name "Futura" by "Grimnir" And Voil√†.
